            <p>
                Whether you're into rock, psychedelia, folk or pop, The Beatles had at least one, if not two, songs that you could listen to.
                Their music was and is still enjoyed by many people of old & young age.

            <h2>Their Movies <i class="fas fa-video"></i></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Though they were not actors, the four made five movies in total!
                They were made to be funny and also brought inspiration to anyone who would watch them.

            <hr>
            <p>
                Musicians, entertainers, actors, producers, everything. They were everything they aspired to be. Noy only in their music, but also their fashion, instruments and personalities.
                Bassists and drummers were always at the back, but Paul & Ringo changed that. Their music still continues to inspire and teach us to be unique.

            <hr>
            <p>
                Each song had their own uniqueness. Whether it was the lyrics, chord progression or whoever wrote it. Each song was different from the last.
                Whoever the songwriter was, a little bit of their personality was always left. It had meaning and life. It was nice to ears and it was true.
